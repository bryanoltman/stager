# Stager

Stager is a Flutter development tool that allows you to run small portions of your app as individual Flutter apps. This lets you:

- Focus your development on a single widget or flow â€“ no more clicking through multiple screens or setting external feature flags to reach the page you're working on.
- Ensure your UI works in *all* cases, including:
  - Light and Dark mode
  - Small or large text sizes
  - Different viewport sizes
  - Different device types
  - Loading, empty, error, and normal states
- Show all of this to your designers to make sure your app is pixel-perfect.

## Demo

![example app demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/581764/219502623-bfe44091-a582-460e-b97d-e786bc614a8c.gif)

The example included in this repo demonstrates how Stager can be used in the context of a simple Twitter-like app that displays a feed of posts and includes detail pages for posts and users.

Stager uses Scenes (see the [Concepts](#concepts) section below) that you define to generate small Flutter apps. To run the Stager apps included in the example, start by moving to the `example` directory and fetching the app's dependencies:

```bash
cd example
flutter pub get
```

You can then run the indivdual Stager apps with the following commands:

**User Detail**
```bash
flutter run -t lib/pages/user_detail/user_detail_page_scenes.stager_app.g.dart
```

**Posts List**
```bash
flutter run -t lib/pages/posts_list/posts_list_page_scenes.stager_app.g.dart
```

**Post Detail**
```bash
flutter run -t lib/pages/post_detail/post_detail_page_scenes.stager_app.g.dart
```

To get an idea of how these Scenes fit together, you can also run the main app by executing `flutter run` from the `example` directory.

## Concepts

### Scene

A Scene is a simple, self-contained unit of UI, and is the most important idea in Stager. Scenes make it easy to focus on a single widget or page to greatly increase development velocity by isolating them from the rest of your app and allowing fine control of dependencies.

To create your own Scene, simply create a `Scene` subclass and implement `title`, the name of your Scene, and `build()`, which constructs the widget you wish to develop or preview.

You can also override the following methods and properties:

#### `setUp`

A function that is called once before the Scene is displayed. This will generally be where you configure your widget's dependencies.

#### `environmentControlBuilders`

An optional list of `WidgetBuilder`-like functions that allow you to add custom Widgets to the Stager control panel. These are useful if you want to manipulate things specific to your app, including:

- Data displayed by your Widget
- Properties on mocked dependenices
- Feature flags

You can return any arbitrary Widget from these functions.

### StagerApp

A StagerApp displays a list of Scenes, allow the user to select from all available Scenes. Because Scenes can contain their own Navigators, the StagerApp overlays a back button on top of the Scenes.

## Use

Imagine you have the following widget buried deep in your application:

<?code-excerpt "shared/posts_list/posts_list.dart (PostsList)"?>
```dart
/// A [ListView] of [PostCard]s
class PostsList extends StatefulWidget {
  /// Creates a [PostsList] displaying [posts].
  ///
  /// [postsFuture] will be set to the value of [posts].
  PostsList({
    Key? key,
    required List<Post> posts,
  }) : this.fromFuture(key: key, Future<List<Post>>.value(posts));

  /// Creates a [PostsList] with a Future that resolves to a list of [Post]s.
  const PostsList.fromFuture(this.postsFuture, {super.key});

  /// The Future that resolves to the list of [Post]s this widget will display.
  final Future<List<Post>> postsFuture;

  @override
  State<PostsList> createState() => _PostsListState();
}

class _PostsListState extends State<PostsList> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder<List<Post>>(
      future: widget.postsFuture,
      builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot<List<Post>> snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
          return const Center(
            child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
          );
        }

        if (snapshot.hasError) {
          return const Center(
            child: Text('Error'),
          );
        }

        final List<Post>? posts = snapshot.data;
        if (posts == null || posts.isEmpty) {
          return const Center(
            child: Text('No posts'),
          );
        }

        return ListView.builder(
          itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) => PostCard(
            post: posts[index],
            onTap: () {
              Navigator.of(context).push(
                MaterialPageRoute<void>(
                  builder: (BuildContext context) => PostDetailPage(
                    post: posts[index],
                  ),
                ),
              );
            },
          ),
          itemCount: posts.length,
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

Normally, exercising all states in this widget would involve:

1. Building and launching the full app.
2. Navigating to this page.
3. Editing the code to force display of the states we want to exercise, either by constructing a fake `Future<List<Post>>` or commenting out the various conditional checks in the FutureBuilder's `builder` function.

Scenes present a better way to do this.

### Building a Scene

We can create a Scene for each state we want to show. For example, a Scene showing the empty state might look something like:

<?code-excerpt "pages/posts_list/posts_list_page_scenes.dart (PostsListPageScene)"?>
```dart
@GenerateMocks(<Type>[Api])
import 'posts_list_page_scenes.mocks.dart';

/// Defines a shared build method used by subclasses and a [MockApi] subclasses
/// can use to control the behavior of the [PostsListPage].
abstract class BasePostsListScene extends Scene {
  /// A mock dependency of [PostsListPage]. Mock the value of [Api.fetchPosts]
  /// to put the staged [PostsListPage] into different states.
  late MockApi mockApi;

  @override
  Widget build() {
    return EnvironmentAwareApp(
      home: Provider<Api>.value(
        value: mockApi,
        child: const PostsListPage(),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  Future<void> setUp() async {
    mockApi = MockApi();
  }
}

/// A Scene showing the [PostsListPage] with no [Post]s.
class EmptyListScene extends BasePostsListScene {
  @override
  String get title => 'Empty List';

  @override
  Future<void> setUp() async {
    await super.setUp();
    when(mockApi.fetchPosts()).thenAnswer((_) async => <Post>[]);
  }
}
```

See the example project for more scenes.

### Running a StagerApp

To generate the `StagerApp`, run:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This will generate a `my_scenes.stager_app.g.dart` file, which contains a `main` function that creates your Scenes and launches a StagerApp. For the above Scene, it would look something like:

<?code-excerpt "pages/posts_list/posts_list_page_scenes.stager_app.g.dart"?>
```dart
// GENERATED CODE - DO NOT MODIFY BY HAND

// **************************************************************************
// StagerAppGenerator
// **************************************************************************

import 'package:stager/stager.dart';

import 'posts_list_page_scenes.dart';

void main() {
  final List<Scene> scenes = <Scene>[
    EmptyListScene(),
    WithPostsScene(),
    LoadingScene(),
    ErrorScene(),
  ];

  if (const String.fromEnvironment('Scene').isNotEmpty) {
    const String sceneName = String.fromEnvironment('Scene');
    final Scene scene =
        scenes.firstWhere((Scene scene) => scene.title == sceneName);
    runStagerApp(scenes: <Scene>[scene]);
  } else {
    runStagerApp(scenes: scenes);
  }
}
```

This can be run using:

```bash
flutter run -t path/to/my_scenes.stager_app.g.dart
```

You can launch to a specific scene by providing the name of the scene as an argument:

```bash
flutter run -t path/to/my_scenes.stager_app.g.dart --dart-define='Scene=No Posts'
```

### Adding your own environment controls

Stager's control panel comes with a generally useful set of controls that enable you to toggle dark mode, adjust text scale, etc. However, it is very likely that your app has unique environment properties that would be useful to adjust. To support this, Scenes have an overridable `environmentControlBuilders` property which allows you to add custom widgets to the default set of environment manipulation controls.

A very simple example:

```dart
class CounterScene extends Scene {
  // Define a custom property that is consumed by the Scene.
  // This might be something as simple as an int, or something
  // more complex, like a mocked network service.
  int count = 0;

  @override
  Widget build() {
    return EnvironmentAwareApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Text(count.toString()),
        ),
      ),
    );
 }

  @override
  String get title => 'Counter';

  @override
  List<EnvironmentControlBuilder> get environmentControlBuilders => [
        (BuildContext context, VoidCallback rebuildScene) {
          // NumberStepperControl is a widget provided by Stager for convenience.
          // However, your EnvironmentControlBuilder can return any arbitrary widget.
          return NumberStepperControl(
            title: const Text('Count'),
            value: count,
            onDecrementPressed: () {
              count -= 1;

              // Call rebuildScene to update the Scene with count's new value
              rebuildScene();
            },
            onIncrementPressed: () {
              count += 1;

              // Call rebuildScene to update the Scene with count's new value
              rebuildScene();
            },
          );
        }
      ];
}
```

More complex examples can be found in `WithPostsScene` in `example/lib/pages/posts_list/posts_list_page_scenes.dart` and `PostDetailPageScene` in `example/lib/pages/post_detail/post_detail_page_scenes.dart`.

## Testing

You may notice that these names are very similar to Flutter testing functions. This is intentional â€“ Scenes are very easy to reuse in tests. Writing Scenes for your widgets can be a great way to start writing widget tests or to expand your widget test coverage. A widget test using a Scene can be as simple as this:

<?code-excerpt "../../test/pages/posts_list_page_test.dart (EmptySceneTest)"?>
```dart
testWidgets('shows an empty state', (WidgetTester tester) async {
  final Scene scene = EmptyListScene();
  await scene.setUp();
  await tester.pumpWidget(scene.build());
  await tester.pump();
  expect(find.text('No posts'), findsOneWidget);
});
```
